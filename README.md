## Introduction

"Minecraft, But Moving Destroys The World" is a challenge datapack which makes your game VERY DIFFICULT and difficult to play. Beware - it is a lot harder than it looks. Whenever you walk off a block that whole column of blocks from the top of the world to bedrock is destroyed. Moving in your world will leave huge craters which are very easy to fall into - trust me. The challenge of course is to beat Minecraft - but beware it will not be easy. Good luck...

## How to Use & Information

This is totally multiplayer compatible. When you load into the world simply type /trigger start_challenge. From that point onwards you will begin to destroy the world as you move around.
